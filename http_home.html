	          Sex trafficking is slavery that uses manipulation to force a victim into acts of sexual
		  conduct. If the victim is under the age of eighteen but gives consent, it is still human 
		  trafficking, however, if the individual participating sexually, exceeds the age of eighteen,
		  it is now considered prostitution. Anyone can be trafficked, no matter age gender, or race.
		  82% of reported human trafficking incidents in the United States between 
		  January 2008 and June 2010 involved allegations of sex trafficking. </div>

		Labor trafficking occurs in numerous industries in the U.S. and globally. In the United 
		States, common types of labor trafficking include people forced to work in homes as 
		domestic servants, farm workers forced through violence as they harvest crops, or factory 
		workers held in inhumane conditions. Labor trafficking accounted for 11% of incidents, 
		and other or unknown forms of human trafficking collected to make up the remaining 7%.</div>
