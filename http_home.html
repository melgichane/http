	    <header><h3>Sex Trafficking</h3>	    
  <p>
	  <center><div>Sex trafficking is slavery that uses manipulation to force a victim into acts of sexual
		  conduct. If the victim is under the age of eighteen but gives consent, it is still human 
		  trafficking, however, if the individual participating sexually, exceeds the age of eighteen,
		  it is now considered prostitution. Anyone can be trafficked, no matter age gender, or race.
		  82% of reported human trafficking incidents in the United States between January 
		  2008 and June 2010 involved allegations of sex trafficking. </div></center>
