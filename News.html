    <div style="margin-left: 300px; display:none;" id = "Kendall">
   <p>One survivor of human trafficking, who calls herself Kendall, told
   authorities that her parents only had her in order to sell her to an
   international sex trafficker. Her life began with sexual abuse, says the survivor,
   and she claims she was molested even before she could even walk.
   Kendall explained that the man, who she referred to only as “the man who owned me,”
   said that she wasn’t allowed to use the word “trafficking.” Kendall was
   told that, “I was made for that [sexual slavery], and trafficking is when
      girls who aren’t made for that get kidnapped or sold into it.</p></div>

    <div style="margin-left: 300px;" id = "Mari">
     <p>Over the course of 16 years, Mari was in a relationship with a
     man who fathered her four children. He was abusive in every way:
     verbally, physically, and sexually. At some point, the man started
     forcing Mari to have sex with other men in order to make some extra cash.
    Along the way, he recruited another girl - a woman named Janice - to join
    his prostitution ring. If not for a fateful traffic stop, both women might
     still be in the monster’s thrall. When they were pulled over, a particularly
      observant officer noticed that the man had both Mari and Janice’s IDs in his
      wallet. This prompted the officer to ask to speak to each of them privately.
       At that point, Mari was able to get some help and free herself of her captor.</p></div>

   <div style="margin-left: 300px;" id = "Phalla">   
    <p>Until the age of 20, Phalla lived a relatively normal life in Cambodia. After
    her father died, with no one to support her family, she was forced to move in with
    her grandmother. About two months after she’d arrived, her grandmother drove her
    into a nearby city, Kampong Som, and sold her to a brothel. Phalla didn't realize
    this until several days after she’d arrived. At the brothel, she was locked in a
    room and raped several times a day. This was was her reality for the next several
    months, being sold from one brothel to another. Then, she met a man who helped
    her back to her native Cambodia. It seemed like a new lease on life, but she was
    soon put to work in a karaoke bar, and her employers sold her to foreign tourists
    for days at a time. When she tried to leave, she was beaten. It took several more
      months before she was able to gain her captor’s confidence, escape, and turn herself</p></div>
    over to authorities.</div>

  <div style="margin-left: 300px;" id = "Sabine">   
  <p>The only surviving member of her family in the wake of the Rwandan genocide, Sabine
  was more than happy to accept an offer working for a wealthy American family. Upon
  her arrival, the girl was imprisoned and forced to work around the clock. She slept
  on the kitchen floor. It took six months before Sabine was allowed one hour off each
  Sunday to go to church. While there, one of her fellow parishioners caught wind of her
  situation and helped her escape. At first, Sabine’s ordeal had left her traumatized.
  She was afraid to leave her new apartment after 4 pm. She was too afraid to go anywhere
  in the city alone, and she was even terrified to use a gift card. A few months later,
  Sabine found her courage. She’s now able to travel on her own, and she's learning English
    as she slowly works to rebuild her life.</p></div>

    <div style="margin-left: 300px;" id = "Loreta">
<p>Loreta was born to two alcoholic parents, and they were incapable of taking care of her
  and her 13 brothers and sisters. At a young age, she and her siblings were shipped off to
  Lithuanian state homes across the country. She lost track of her family.Soon after she arrived
  at the state home, Loreta was visited by a man who called himself her godfather. He began visiting
  her repeatedly. The other kids told her she was lucky, and she felt that way too, until her
  “godfather” raped her at the age of 13. At 15, she was sent to live with him against her will.
  After her 16th birthday, Loreta was courted by a madam named Dana, who befriended the teen
  with promises of fun before ultimately luring Loreta and six of her friends into a life of
  forced prostitution. For two years, Loreta lived with Dana before the madam sold her to a pimp
  in Ravenna, Italy.In Italy, she was forced to have sex with clients in the public restrooms within
  a 15 minute window. It wasn’t until she happened to have a client that spoke Lithuanian that Loreta
  dared beg for help. Fortunately, the john had a change of heart and took Loreta and some of her friends
  to the Italian police. They helped get her some documentation and return back home.</p></div>
